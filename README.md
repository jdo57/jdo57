## Welcome! My name is Josue Ortiz!

## Background
I am currently a student at Cornell University within the College of Engineering. I am a computer science and operations research in engineering (ORIE) major, with a physics minor. 

  - At Cornell I am involved in several activities which include being on the [Cornell Auto-Boat](https://www.cornellautoboat.com/) project team within the ground station subteam and previously worked on microcontroller design.
  
  - During Summer 2024 I interned at Ernst & Young (EY) as a software engineer! This gave me my first glimpse within the software engineering world, alongside a look within consulting and other practices!
  
  - This upcoming Summer 2025 I will be interning at Wells Fargo as a software engineer under their Technology department!
  
  Feel free to reach out about any questions, or ideas you would like to collaborate on! Keep on coding! 
  Please contact me through either email: <a href="mailto:jdo57@cornell.edu" target="_blank">jdo57@cornell.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:josueortizordonez10@gmail.com" target="_blank">josueortizordonez10@gmail.com</a>.

## Experience

  - Employed as a software engineer under EYâ€™s technology consulting department, under their Launch Internship program, serving clients within the National Technology Consulting (NTO) branch. Involved through the Artificial Intelligence & Data (AI & D), and Digital Engineering service lines, primarily focusing on UI/UX design, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and machine learning clustering algorithms.
  - Teaching assistant for [CS/INFO 3300](https://jeffrz.com/info3300/): Visual Data Analytics for the Web (previously known as Data-Driven Web Applications,) taught by Assistant Professor [Jeff Rzeszotarski](https://jeffrz.com/).
  - I assisted students on how to utilize langauges such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well as the library that is primarily utilized to teach the course, d3.js. Emphasis on crtique and design choices.
  - Using languages such as Python, C++, and Javascript, and tools such as React on Cornell Auto-boat to design microcontollers and our UI platform.
